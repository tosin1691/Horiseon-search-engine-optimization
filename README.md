# Horiseon-search-engine-optimization

## Description

As requested by the client, the current codebase was refactored to ensure it adheres to accessibility standards and the site is optimized for search engines. More specifically we updated the following on HTML and CSS

HTML:

1) I updated the title element to be more concise and descriptive to improve search engine results for users
2) I added meta description to raise the click-through rather of search results
3) I added alt text to images to improve accessibility
4) we made the HTML and CSS more semantic by using conventional tags for a better structure to the page and help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of web pages.
